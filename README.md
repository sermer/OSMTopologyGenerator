# OSMTopologyGenerator
The goal of this project is to take in an OSM file, extract any elevation data that exists, and then generate as good of the 3D model as possible. It would then create a file which could be 3D printed. Due to how little height data is included, this will never be super accurate. It is just for fun/a challenge.
